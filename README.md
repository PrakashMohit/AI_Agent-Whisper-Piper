# AI_Agent-Whisper-Maya-1
Created an AI AGENT which uses whisper STT and Maya TTS locally along with Ollama to provide an assistant behaviour vocally.

# Update ---><br>
I am using Piper TTS as i dont have GPU or Collab Pro

# Update 2 ----><br>
Ive added a smaller whisper model and updated my program to play audio throug sounddevice library directly instead of calling ffplay and introduced threading which helped me reduce the latency from 1 minute to 10 seconds.
